        <p>I want to visit these places because they all look very cool to me. I have seen all of these places in movies and youtube videos and I would enjoy to see them In real life. The only place on this list that I have been to is Seaside and I put that place on the list because I enjoyed visiting it so much,  hopefully I will go there over spring break. I have been to New York City but it was when I was very young so I don't remember much about it so it would be cool to go there again and see the city with an older perspective. Iv seen the movie Rio and that was really cool, and Rio also heald some world cup games so I got to see some of Rio over the T.V and the internet. I have never been to Rio, London, Dubai, and Paris. Going to the Effile tower would be really cool, same as going to that really tall building in Dubai, I think it's the tallest sky scraper in the world. Going on the London Eye would be really cool too, its like a huge ferris wheel.</p>
