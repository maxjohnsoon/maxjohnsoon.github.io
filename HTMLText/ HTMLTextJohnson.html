  <h1><strong>Welcome to my web page.</strong></h1>
  <h4><strong>(Lets learn HTML!)</strong></h4>
  <p>Before we start let me tell you a little about myself. This is the 1<sup>st</sup> time that I have taught this course. I was born at a very young age and grew in wisdom and grace
    until now. Of course, I hope to continue to grow in both wisdom and grace but that will require effort and attention to what is happening in the world and in myself. I hope you
    learn a lot about web programming and are enlightened by what we do in the class. Good luck!</p>

  <p>When writing web pages you need to make sure that you are attentive to lots of details like the structure and formatting of the page. I want to <strong>emphasize</strong> to you
    the important of this. </p>
<hr />
  <p>I want to make sure that you understand what I mean so I would like to quote myself. <blockquote>It is very important to be aware of all the small details when writing web pages.
    Afterall, small details can make a big difference. Be conscious of what you are learning and why you are learning it. We will certainly learn a lot in this class but we must always
    exert effort to learn</blockquote></p>
